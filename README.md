# Acharya-symposium website
- This is website was created and **designed & developed within 6 hours**, this is a rough work which was mainly created to demonstrate what the final product will look like.
- This created for an aeronautical symposium organised at Acharya Institute of Technology.
- Unfortunately, they didn't select the design because they wanted to go with something traditional and I couldn't convince them to go for a "bit modern and minimalistic" design.
- Eventhough its rough, I decided to upload it mainly because of the challenges I overcame while designing. And also the finished product looked decent enough.

## Challenges
- One of the main challenges was that there was too much textual content. One of the first principles of modern websites is that "less is more", people rarely read large blocks of texts on a website. So I had to experiment a lot with Typography, Fonts, Font-color, Font-Weight, Line-spacing, Line-height etc. And also to fit all the text in the website without disturbing its aesthetic nature.
- There was a 4-col. tables in the content, So there was a challenge to convert columns of the table into the design. I used icons and undifferentiated columns to make it aesthetically pleasing
